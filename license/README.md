# Guardrails – Licensing overview

Guardrails is distributed under an **open-core** model.

This directory documents:
- what is open-source
- what is commercial
- how licenses are generated and enforced
- what users are allowed (and not allowed) to do

The goal is clarity, trust, and long-term sustainability.
