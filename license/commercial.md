# Commercial licensing

## Scope

Commercial licenses apply only to non-open-source components of ContractShield.

These components are distributed under a proprietary license and are not covered by Apache 2.0.

---

## Typical licensed features

Depending on the offering tier:
- advanced runtime enforcement (sink-aware RASP)
- certified policy packs (e.g. Stripe, OAuth, uploads)
- policy management UI
- audit and compliance exports
- enterprise support and SLA

---

## License model (indicative)

Licenses are typically:
- per service or application
- per environment (prod / staging)
- time-based (annual subscription)

Exact terms are defined in commercial agreements.

---

## License enforcement (technical)

Commercial features may use:
- signed license keys
- offline verification
- optional periodic validation

ContractShield Core **never phones home** and never requires a license key.

---

## Principle

Open-source users must never be locked out, degraded, or broken.

Commercial licensing exists to:
- fund development
- provide advanced features
- support enterprise needs

Not to restrict freedom of the core.
