# Apache License 2.0 – Explanation & usage

## Why Apache License 2.0

ContractShield Core is licensed under **Apache License 2.0** because it:

- allows commercial use
- allows modification and redistribution
- provides an explicit patent grant
- is widely accepted in enterprise environments
- avoids viral copyleft constraints

Apache 2.0 is particularly well suited for security infrastructure projects.

## What Apache 2.0 allows you to do

You are allowed to:
- use ContractShield Core in production
- use it in proprietary or commercial products
- modify the source code
- redistribute modified or unmodified versions
- bundle it with your own software

---

## Your obligations under Apache 2.0

When redistributing ContractShield Core (or modified versions), you must:
- include the Apache 2.0 license text
- preserve copyright notices
- document any significant changes you made

You do **not** have to:
- open-source your own code
- contribute changes back
- disclose proprietary logic

---

## Patent grant

Apache 2.0 includes a patent license:
- contributors grant users a license to any patents they hold that are necessarily infringed by their contributions
- this provides strong legal safety for adopters

If a contributor initiates patent litigation against users of the project, the patent license terminates.

## How ContractShield manages Apache 2.0 licensing

- A `LICENSE` file is included at the root of the repository
- Source files include copyright headers where appropriate
- Open-source and commercial code are kept in separate modules or repositories
- Commercial features do not modify or restrict the Apache-licensed core

Apache 2.0 applies **only** to the open-source core components.
