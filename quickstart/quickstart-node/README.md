# ContractShield Quick Start — Node.js (10–15 minutes)

Date: 2026-01-15

This quick start shows ContractShield enforcing declared intent on a single endpoint.

## What you'll see
- One endpoint: `/api/license/activate`
- One policy
- One request allowed
- One request blocked (deterministic, explained)

## Run
```bash
npm install
node src/index.js
```

Then try the scripts in `scripts/`.
